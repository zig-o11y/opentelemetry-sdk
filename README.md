> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is a Work In Progress and not ready for production.
> In fact, it is not even ready for development as it is incomplete in its current form.

This is an implementation of the OpenTelemetry specification for the [Zig](https://ziglang.org) programming language.

The version of the specification targeted here is **1.35.0**.

## Goals

1. Provide a Zig library implementing the _stable_ features of an OpenTelemtry SDK:
    * Metrics
    * Traces
    * Logs
1. Provide a reference implementation of the OpenTelemetry API
1. Provide examples on how to use the library in real-world use cases
